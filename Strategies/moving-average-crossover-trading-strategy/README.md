Moving Average (MA) =  a commonly used technical indicator that shows the average price of an asset over a specified period of time. Moving averages are used to smooth out the short-term price fluctuations of an asset and provide traders with a clearer picture of the underlying trend.   

Simple Moving Average (SMA) = This is the most basic type of moving average, which calculates the average price of an asset over a set number of periods by simply summing up the prices and dividing by the number of periods. The SMA is popular among traders as it is easy to understand and calculate.  

Exponential Moving Average (EMA) = This type of moving average gives greater weight to recent prices and is more responsive to short-term price movements compared to the SMA. The EMA is calculated using a smoothing factor that places more weight on recent prices, resulting in a faster adjustment to market changes.  

Weighted Moving Average (WMA) = This type of moving average also gives greater weight to recent prices, but the weighting is done differently than the EMA. In a WMA, each price point is assigned a weight based on its position in the period, with the most recent prices given the highest weights. The WMA is a compromise between the SMA and EMA, providing a balance between smoothness and responsiveness.  

Moving Average Crossover = a popular trading strategy that uses two or more moving averages to identify potential buy and sell signals. The basic idea behind this strategy is to compare two moving averages of different lengths and look for a crossover where one moving average crosses above or below the the other. The two moving averages can be the same type, but traders can also choose two different types to look for a crossover.
## Buy vs Sell Signals:

A buy signal (+1) is triggered when the faster average (e.g. SMA10) crosses above the slower average (e.g. SMA50), while a sell signal (-1) is triggered when the faster average (e.g. SMA10) crosses below the slower one (e.g. SMA50).

## Sharpe ratio:

Sharpe ratio = a measure of risk-adjusted return. It describes how much excess return you receive for the volatility of holding a riskier asset. In general higher Sharpe ratio signifes better risk-adjusted returns.
